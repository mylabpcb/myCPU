### Useful software tools to manage and configure myCPU.

Under the EncoderCLI folder you can find the Command Line tool to generate a binary file with the encoded microprogramming from the myCPU ISA definition file. 

You can use that file to write the encoded microprogramming, generated by the Encoder CLI, to the Instruction Decoder memories using an EEProm programmer or to write the simulator decoder memories.
