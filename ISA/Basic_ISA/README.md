### The Basec myCPU16 ISA documents
This is the default ISA for the myCPU16 project.

Here is the Basic myCPU16 Instruction Set (**ISA**) definition file with the output files generated with the **myCPU EncoderCLI**.
The "json" file is the definition file. The "bin" file is the compiled file to write to the EEProm memory and the "dat" file is for checking purposes.

There's another "dat" file with headers for better readability.
