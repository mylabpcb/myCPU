According to the open architecture of myCPU, you can be built using the provided module boards with the kit or you can design your own modules and build yours modules in the way that you want.

There’s available a module protoboard compatible with the mechanical rules of the BUS module connectors, and two templates for Circuitmaker based on the design of the provided modules in the myCPU kit. There’s no templates for Kicad, but I think could be easy to port those templates from Circuitmaker to Kicad.
