Below you can find a download link to a zip file with the full list of components of myCPU instead the partial list you cand find in the technical document of each module. The zip file contains 2 different BOM lists: a list with the exact quantity of units needed to build the myCPU and another list with a more rounded quantity according to what you can buy in chinese component stores like Aliexpress.

You can use the accurate list to buy in more qualified (but more expensive) stores like Digikey or Mouser and the rounded list to buy in cheap chinese stores like Aliexpress or on eBay.

> I recommended to buy more units than the needed as spare parts, because at the beginning is easy to burn or the destroy some components
