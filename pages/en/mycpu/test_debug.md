When I speak of **Testing** and **Debugging**, Iâ€™m talking about two different tasks. Testing refers to check if the hardware of a module board is working as it should under specific electronic conditions and Debugging is related to check if a module board is working as it should according to a software instruction and in sync with the rest of the devices.

So we can do testing the myCPU modules ever I want using the testing switches of BUS manager or CSM, but we can debugging only during running operation and when executing a program. It means that we can test a module board over partially finished myCPU but we can debug only over a fully finished myCPU capable of executing a program.
