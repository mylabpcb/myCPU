**myLabPcb** is my own and personal initiative to share electronic designs projects under MIT Licence. At this moment, I’ve finished my first project, the **myCPU** design, which is a redesign on PCBs of the Ben Eater’s 8- bit breadboards computer. After that I’m working in the design of the myCPU Plus with a new set of modules having support for 16 bits, more memory and a bigger instruction set.

Also I’m planning the design of myEnigma, a digital replica of the Enigma Machine without programming, and supporting to exchangeable digital rotors.

The purpose of this initiative is not only share electronics designs but share designs very focused on learning. Enjoy and learn is my rule, for that reason I’ll keep much of my attention in the modularity, open architecture and possibilities of customization so everyone can try to design their own modules and get a very personal build.

The projects you can find in this site are directed to engineering students, teachers, electronics hobbyists, smart kids with a bit of help, and all people who want to enjoy building a electronic project and playing with a device built by yourself.

I love digital electronics and microcomputers, more interested in the early days of computer design than the modern days. Probably because that technology is more afforable for individuals and unexperienced electronic designers like me.

I’m a Computer Engineering degree student at **UNED**, which is the public open university here in Spain. Sadly, I think I’m not a good student. -:) but I will try. At the moment of writing this, January 19 of 2022, I’m in my first year.
